        <h4>Houseplant Sticky Stakes</h4>
        <p>If your houseplants are infested with whiteflies, fungus gnats, blackflies, thrips, fruit flies, or midges, try Safer Brand’s houseplant sticky stakes. Each green stake features three to four sticky yellow strips that attract plant pests like magnets without the use of harmful pesticides.
        </p>
        <p>Simply stick one into the soil and gently shake the plant to release any pests and encourage them to swarm the strips. When the strips are full, toss the stake and replace with a fresh one.
