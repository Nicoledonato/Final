        <p id="e9">Peperomias are a diverse group of small, easy-care houseplants with waxy and often highly textured leaves. Some of our favorite varieties include ripple peperomia, watermelon peperomia, baby rubber plant, and silverleaf peperomia.</p>
        <p id="e10">This plant's leaves feature various shades of silver, gray, green, and even pink and red, making Chinese evergreen an attractive choice to brighten low-light areas of your home. You'll often see them in a shopping mall or airport plantings because they are so adaptable and durable, yet attractive.</p>
        <p id="e11">'Ellen Danica,' the variety of grape ivy pictured here is also called oakleaf ivy because its leaves are more deeply cut than other types of grape ivy. No matter which variety you choose, the tendrils on a vine of grape ivy will easily cling to a trellis or a stake. Its shiny, deep green leaves also create a nice texture for an indoor hanging basket.
